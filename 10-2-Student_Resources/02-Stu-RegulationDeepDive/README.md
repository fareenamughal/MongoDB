# Regulation Deep Dive

In this activity, you'll select one of the regulations you have learned about, review it with your group, and find an example of when this regulation was violated.

## Instructions

1. Recall your chosen regulation to research:

  * General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
  * California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)
  * Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Act, Section 5
  * Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA)&mdash;finance
  * Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA)&mdash;finance
  * Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA)&mdash;education
  * Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)&mdash;healthcare
  * Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA)&mdash;children
  * Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA)&mdash;communications

2. As a group, discuss what your chosen regulation governs. Summarize what this rule requires of the people and organizations that must follow it.

3. Type the name of your rule followed by "violation" in your favorite search engine. If the search engine has a way to specifically search for news articles, using that might help narrow down your search.

4. Share what you find with your group. Then, as a group, decide on a violation to discuss. For this violation, answer the following questions:

    * Who violated the rule?
    * What specific aspect of the rule did they violate?
    * Who was responsible for enforcing the rule when it was violated?
    * How did that responsible person or organization enforce the rule?
    * Do you agree with how the rule was enforced? Do you think the punishment was fair?

5. Choose someone from your group to share a summary of your discussion.

6. If time permits, either discuss another violation of your chosen rule or research violations of a different rule from the list in Step 1.
